# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting medical insurance costs for individuals based on several factors including age, gender, BMI (Body Mass Index), number of children, smoking habits, and region. By leveraging data science techniques, particularly through machine learning, the goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate insurance charges.

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Collection & Analysis
- **Dataset**: The dataset (`insurance.csv`) contains demographic information and insurance charges for individuals.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial analysis involves understanding the distribution of variables, identifying correlations, and gaining insights into the dataset.

### 2. Data Pre-Processing
- **Feature Encoding**: Categorical features like gender, smoker status, and region are encoded to numerical values suitable for modeling.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, or any inconsistencies in the dataset to ensure data quality.

### 3. Model Training & Evaluation
- **Model Selection**: Linear regression is chosen as the predictive model due to its interpretability and suitability for regression tasks.
- **Training**: The model is trained on the pre-processed data to learn relationships between features and insurance costs.
- **Evaluation**: Performance metrics such as R-squared are used to assess the model's accuracy on both training and test datasets.

### 4. Building a Predictive System
- **Deployment**: Using the trained model to build a predictive system that can estimate insurance costs based on input data (age, gender, BMI, etc.).
- **Instructions**: Detailed steps on how to run the code and utilize the predictive system are provided for ease of use.

## Files in the Repository

- **data.csv**: Dataset containing the insurance information.
- **insurance_cost_prediction.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing Python code for the project, including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
- **README.md**: Overview of the project, instructions for running the code, contact information, and licensing details.
- **LICENSE.md**: MIT License information for the project.

## Instructions for Running the Code

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn are installed.
2. **Clone Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. **Run Jupyter Notebooks**: Open and run `insurance_cost_prediction.ipynb` in the specified order to replicate the analysis, model training, and deployment.
